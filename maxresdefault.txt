Hello! My name is Ana. I am eight years old and I am
from the USA. I’m going to introduce you to my lovely
family. It is quite big and we are very happy.

My mother’s name is Laura and my father’s is Peter. My
mother has got blond hair and she is very tender. My father is
tall and slim and he is a funny person.

My parents have got three children. There’s my brother
Tim, my baby brother David and me. Tim is a sweet boy who
loves playing and being with me all the time. He is only three
years old so he attends the kindergarten. My younger brother,
David, is a seven-month baby but he is full of personality. He
likes being at my father’s lap and he never disposes of Eddy,
his bunny.
